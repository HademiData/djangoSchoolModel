We have several models representing different entities within a school database:

School: Represents a school with fields such as name and address.

Student: Represents a student with fields like name. It has a foreign key relationship (school) with the School model, indicating that each student belongs to a particular school.

Teacher: Represents a teacher with fields like name. It also has a foreign key relationship (school) with the School model, indicating that each teacher belongs to a specific school.

Course: Represents a course with fields like name. It has a foreign key relationship (teacher) with the Teacher model, indicating that each course is taught by a particular teacher.

Enrollment: Represents the enrollment of a student in a course. It has foreign key relationships (student and course) with the Student and Course models, respectively. This model connects the student and course entities, indicating which students are enrolled in which courses.

The ForeignKey field is used to define the relationship between models. The on_delete=models.CASCADE parameter specifies that if a related object (e.g., a school or a teacher) is deleted, all associated objects (e.g., students or courses) will also be deleted.

The __str__ method is defined in each model to provide a string representation of the model instance. It helps in displaying meaningful information when these models are referenced or displayed in the Django admin interface or other parts of the application.

Remember to run Django migrations after defining your models to create the corresponding database tables. This can be done using the python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate commands.

These models demonstrate a basic schema for a school database using Django's relational database capabilities. You can further extend and customize the models based on the specific requirements of your school database.
